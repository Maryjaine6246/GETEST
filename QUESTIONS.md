# Questions about Project 
 - In the example the amount to order is listed as 363.6lbs but when doing the arithmetic I get 367lbs. I'm not sure how a float is returned when all data given are whole numbers. Am I missing information about the required arithmetic? 
 
 - Should kibble size be another variable that is considered in the formula since different dog sizes require different kibble sizes?
 
 - Should ingredients be considered when ordering food to account for dogs with specific allergies?
